                    <h3>South Ayrshire</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p1>
                        Ayr is a popular seaside resort in south Ayrshire.
                        <br>

                        Located 37 miles south west of Glasgow, Ayr is a popular seaside resort, complete with charming sea front, leafy suburbs and range of places to stay.
                        <br>
                        
                        Ayr has a fantastic esplanade with a long sandy beach which is perfect for walking. There are also plenty of parking spaces on either side of the main road that runs parallel with the beach.
                        <br>
                        
                        Ayr Racecourse, dating back to the 16th century, runs many Flat and National Hunt meetings throughout the year and is particularly famous as the venue of the Scottish Grand National, the Ayrshire Handicap and the Ayr Gold Cup.
                        <br>
                        Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, was born in Alloway, on the outskirts of the town. Visitors should make the short trip to visit his birthplace and the new Robert Burns Birthplace Museum.
                        <br>
                        There are also great shopping and dining facilities in Ayr and three public golf courses: Belleisle, Seafield and Dalmilling.

                <br>
                <p1> The formation of Ayr had begun all the way back in 1197, when King William the Lion ordered his Castle be built between the River Ayr and River Doon. In order to support the increase in population, plots of land were sold by the king for homes, farms and shops for the benifit of its new residents.</p1>
                <br>
                    <p1>Soon after in 1205, the King declared Ayr as a Royal Burgh and Market Town. Ayr’s economy soon flourished, boasting a thriving wool and shipbuilding industry. It also became a busy trade hub, with imports coming from across Europe.  </p1>

Burns grew up as astute reader and learned multiple languages such as French and some Latin. He published his first poems, “Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect” in the year 1786 to immediate success.</p1>
                <br>
                    <p1>Burns cottage still remains to this day and is preserved by the National Trust of Scotland and is open as a tourist attraction available to the public. </p1>
                <br>
                    <p1>A monument to Robert Burns was built in 1891 in Burns Statue Square commemorating his poems and his influence to not just Scotland, but around the globe.</p1>

                <h3><b<>The 19th Century</b></h3>
                <br>
                <p1>Whist most towns and cities were altered with the sweeping wave of industrialisation. The town of Ayr chose to hold on to its small-town roots and chose not to become a manufacturing hotspot, despite the town’s rapid population increase. Ayr soon became a scenic tourist destination, helped by the railway connecting Ayr to Glasgow opened in 1840.   </p1>

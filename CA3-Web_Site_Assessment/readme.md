The website has been designed with a sleek but simple minimalist design, which is easy to navigate and allows the 
user to take in all the information displayed without feeling overwhelmed with unnecessary or distracting imagery,
fonts etc. The color palate is simple, but bold, the use of rgb(101, 131, 45) symbolizes peace and harmony, relaxing the
user, furthermore it is essential in the page for distinguishing areas in which the user can click links, drawing the
user towards them. The use of the off-white background rgb(245,245,245) was chosen instead of a clear white to symbolize the
history and stories that have came from the town, clear white would imply the town is sterile and void of history, This
is evidently not true. 

There were many challenges I dealt with over the course of making this website. Making the navigation bar was a challenge
for me as I needed to learn to make a horizontal list with spacing in between them, whilst also having to enter the logo
on the opposite side of the list.  
Another challenge was correctly positioning the images in website so they they fitted in with the paragraphs.
